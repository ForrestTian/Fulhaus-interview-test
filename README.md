# Fulhaus-interview-test

This is a interview test, honestly, this is the most difficult a test to me. I have not learned the deep learning yet, 
even though I have learned maching learning. Not too bad, I took 12 hours to learn it and try my best to do well, 
that will benefit for my  next term's course. Thank you! 
Addtional, you can see I store a lot of code related my Data Science major, you may know my real professional level, much better than this test.
I still hope to work with yo if possible, despite this test score what is.  Thank you!
